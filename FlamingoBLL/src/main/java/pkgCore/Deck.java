	//			ArrayList<Card> with cards (depending on number of decks).
	
	//			Example: Deck(1) will build one 52-card deck.  There are 52 different cards
	//			2 clubs, 3 clubs... Ace clubs, 2 hearts, 3 hearts... Ace hearts, etc
	
	//			Deck(2) will create an array of 104 cards.
	
	
	//	TODO: Add a draw() method that will take a card from the deck and
	//			return it to the caller
